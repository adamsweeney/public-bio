						<p>Hello, I'm Adam. I am currently looking for work remotely or in the Toronto area. I've been in the industry
							for 6 years now, and have a variety of experience in different areas such as test automation, desktop application development
							and more predominately web development.
						</p>
						<p>I was born in Mississauga, and was raised here for 12 years. Eventually my parents bought a house in Barrie, and this is where I saw
							myself going to college and graduating from Georgian College, and getting my first job at Lyris Inc. I discovered a love for programming
					  	in grade 11. This is where I took my first programming course, and learned all about Turing. I enjoyed that ability to create something
					  	on the computer, as I was never quite a handy individual with wood, metal etc. So this was a great outlet to see my ideas come to fruition.
						</p>
						<p>On a personal standpoint. I have a love for sports. I enjoy just about most sports including Hockey, Soccer, Football, Golf. I also have
							quite the admiration for travel. I spent a year living in Australia, and traveled around as a backpacker there. I've also been to Cuba, Costa Rica,
							Iceland, United States and New Zealand. (New Zealand being an easy favorite).
						</p>

						<p>My current mindset has to always been be able to solve your own problem. So over the years I've kind've dabbled in all sorts of different
							technologies. For the last 2 years I've been doing Rails solely as my backend technology, with mixtures of Javascript frameworks like:
							Ember, React, Knockout and tiny little bit of Angular. I also enjoy Android development, although it's something i've only picked up recently,
							as well as being able to design things; However, I still need a lot of practise with the likes of Illustrator.
